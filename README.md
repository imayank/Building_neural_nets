Building Neural Network from scratch
===

This repository contains the project work from Coursera's Deep Learning specialization course Neural Networks and Deep Learining. In this
repository three python notebooks are included that builds neural network using numpy. First a simple logistic regression is implemented as 
a single perceptron unit. In the second notebook a neural network with single hiden layer is built for classification. Then a deep neural 
network is implemented is the third notebook. Finally a deep neural network id built to classify cat images.
